Why Elixir?
==============

  * Security: Is it highly optimized C that is hard to read
    but easier to crack?
  * Unicode and string support
  * Performance.
  * Background jobs, in-memory data, etc... all in one-package.

Many other options were looked at: OpenResty, Turbo.Lua, Rhoda Ruby, Python, Crystal, etc.
Elixir was finally chosen because of security, then convience, then Unicode & string support.

Rust was also rejected for maturity of libraries and the necessity
of declaring types. (This is a preference and not to be used to
    denounce Rust.)
