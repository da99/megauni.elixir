I believe there are lots of conspiracies, and most of them fail. The biggest and most powerful of the conspiracies are those that have been closest to the dark side of the general population. Conspirators appeal publicly to the good side of people, but they implement their programs by means of the dark side. They say that they want to help the poor, but they will help themselves. The voters say they want to help the poor, when in fact they help themselves. \r\n\r\nThe moment people think that they can make a living by voting instead of making a living by producing, they turn the government and the social order over to one or another conspiracy. \r\n\r\nSecret or not, they could not get into our wallets unless we allowed them to. It is the essence of the conspiracy to persuade the public that the right and moral thing to do is to allow the state to help some group. As soon as the conspiracy persuades the public of this, the game switches from persuasion to power. It switches from donations to taxation. It switches from liberty to tyranny.\r\n\r\nRead the rest: http://www.lewrockwell.com/north/north863.html","title":"The Foundations of a Successful Conspiracy","updated_at":"2010-07-10 05:35:41","public_labels":[],"owner_id":{"$oid": "4bbce6566191537a71000002"},"lang":"en-us","message_model":"e_chapter","privacy":"public","labels":[],"target_ids":[{"$oid": "4bbce6566191537a710000a0"}]},{"_id":{"$oid": "4c38ef6e1f1dcb4889000006"},"created_at":"2010-07-10 22:08:46","data_model":"Message","body":"\"It's laughable to accuse James of narcissism when he turned down a chance to stay in Cleveland, where he'd be worshipped by locals and applauded by the press, to go to Miami, a less sports-driven market where he knows he&rsquo;ll share the spotlight with two other players.

It is why officers of opposing armies have more in common with one another than they have with their own enlisted men. Officers are trained to think of the lower ranks as canon fodder. Officers know when they send a unit up a hill, some men will be killed. That is why they do not fraternize with the lower ranks. This class distinction exists across the world, and is the basis of the accommodation. It is why the Bush family flew the bin Laden family, and other Saudi Royals, out of the United States in the days after 9-11. If anyone was a case officer to the 9-11 bombers, or had knowledge about the bombers or any follow-up plots, it was these \"protected\" people.\r\n\r\nCIA officers too are among the Protected Few.

The nuclear physicists have nevertheless misled the astrophysicists into thinking that a stable thermonuclear reaction is possible inside the Sun even though it results in a weird body that transfers internal heat unlike any other&mdash;by radiation instead of conduction and convection. And the Sun is a cosmic body that is assumed to have much the same composition at its center as at the top of its atmosphere!
